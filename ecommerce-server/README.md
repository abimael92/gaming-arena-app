# üöÄ Getting started

Before you begin setting up Strapi, ensure you have the necessary accounts and configurations in place.

## AWS Setup

1. **Create an AWS Account**:

   - Sign up for an account on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. **Set Up S3 Bucket**:

   - Go to the S3 service in AWS and create a bucket with ACL enabled.

3. **IAM Configuration**:

   - In IAM (Identity and Access Management), create a new policy with permissions for the S3 service.
   - Select all actions for S3 and define the resource bucket ARN as `{bucketname}` with any object.
   - Save the policy and attach it to a new user.

4. **Access Credentials**:

   - Once the user is created, obtain the access key and secret access key.
   - Save these credentials securely as they are required for Strapi configuration.

   ## üìù Reminder:

Save these credentials securely as they are required for Strapi configuration.
